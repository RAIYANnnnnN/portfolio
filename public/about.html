<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Raiyan, i'm a college student and my dream is to build a successful career in the IT field having experties in many major factors. I aim to work for any worldwide renowned franchise.</p>

<p>Currently i've decided to start the journey as a programmer by enrolling in a course for those who want to learn full stack development. I've chosen full stack web development as building this skill takes quite some time as its not possible to master all aspects of building a proper website within a short time.</p>

<p>Since i'm learning web development, I aim to master all the aspects in building a website and be able to build a full fledge website for myself to show it to others and to keep my profile in it.I've started this website with just basic html, but gradually i'll add in other languages and interactive objects to complete the website as I move forward in the course. Wish me luck!!</p>
